## Required Scopes

To grant the service account access to Google Sheets and Google Drive, include the following scopes:

```json
"scope": [
  "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets",  // Allows full access to Google Sheets.
  "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"          // Allows full access to Google Drive.
]

```
